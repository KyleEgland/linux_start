# linux_start
Linux starter kit.

## Synopsis
Restarting on a Linux system (inclusive of WSL) can be tedious - one must install dependencies, gather and setup tools, fuss with configurations, etc. This project is intended to stream-line that by putting all the necessary things in one place. Linux Start is a kit of notes and scripts to help setup development environments, various tools, and configurations - all currated for my needs.

__NOTE:__ This project is being actively created and is really intended to be notes for myself; however, should you find it useful, please feel free to use/clone/fork to your hearts content. That being said, I am not looking for any contributions.

## Contents

* __Configuration:__ Contains basic configuration files for addition or replacement (I.e. `.bash_aliases`)
* __GitSetup:__ Notes on various things git
* __GoLang:__ Covers getting started with the Go programming language
* __Python:__ Covers getting started with the Python programming language
